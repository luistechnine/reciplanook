## Dependencies

### spring-boot-starter-parent

Provides default configurations for the application and a complete dependency tree to quickly build the Spring Boot project. 
It also provides default configurations for Maven plugins, such as _maven-failsafe-plugin_, _maven-jar-plugin_, _maven-surefire-plugin_ and _maven-war-plugin_.
Beyond that, it also inherits dependency management from _spring-boot-dependencies_, which is the parent to the _spring-boot-starter-parent_.
